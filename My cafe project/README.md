# README

This is my first python project. I did this whilst at Generation UK & Ireland junior data engineering bootcamp. 

In the course I learned how to write clean, testable code in python and carry out unit tests on all my functions. I also learned how SQL, data cleaning, data normalisation, how to get data onto AWS and autoomatically run your code when new data is uploaded. I have had insights into APIs Snowflake and many other technologies and softwares over this course. 

Aside from the technical skills I learnt, I also developed my soft skills. I am persistant, always open to growth, a team p[layer, detail oriented, a good communicator and I plan for the future.

# Project Outline

In this project I was tasked with creating an application for a cafe owner. The app needed to allow the owner to add, remove and update their products, couriers and orders.
All the data is saved onto seperate csv files and then also appened onto a database that updates in real time.
